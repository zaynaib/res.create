## How the app works

Each user will sign up for res.create by inputting their email address and creating a password. This will then result in res.create saving their resume information so every time they log in, their resume information they inputted previously is accessible to them. 

Deployment Link to res.create can be found on Heroku : https://res-create.herokuapp.com


 ## Running Locally

 Make sure you have Node.js on your local machine.

 ```
 git clone https://github.com/zaynaib/res.create.git or clone your own fork
 npm install
 npm start

 ```

 Your app should now be running on localhost:3000.
